desc: "In the wild west of code, where commits are currency and bugs are bounties, I've lassoed a few rogue repos of my own into the open-source corral. No cape-wearing heroics to massive orgs (yet—watch this space), but I've unleashed tools like a math-whiz agent that outsmarts equations faster than you can say 'pi-r-squared,' and a cirrhosis predictor sharper than a surgeon's scalpel. Think of it as my digital graffiti: bold, useful, and occasionally chaotic. Fork at your own risk—contributions welcome, coffee not included.",
