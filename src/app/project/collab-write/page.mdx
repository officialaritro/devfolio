  # CollabWrite - Collaborative Knowledge Sharing

  - [View Live Project](https://collabwrite.appwrite.network/)
  - [View Source Code](https://github.com/shivam-taneja/CollabWrite)

  <SubSection title="About The Project">
    - CollabWrite is an open source knowledge-sharing platform where anyone can explore posts without logging in.
    - Registered users can create, edit, and collaborate on posts in real-time using a rich text editor, similar to Google Docs-style collaboration.
    - The feed updates automatically when new knowledge posts are added, making it a living, community-driven knowledge base.
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="Inspiration">
    - The idea is inspired by creating a "Wikipedia meets Notion".
    - I wanted to build something more open and community-driven than traditional note-taking apps.
    - While tools like Google Docs and Notion are great, they are usually private and siloed.
    - CollabWrite brings the best of both worlds:
      - The openness of a public knowledge feed
      - The power of collaborative editing
      - The simplicity of contributing knowledge without barriers
