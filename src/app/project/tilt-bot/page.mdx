  # Tilt-Bot - AI Gaming Roast Generator

  - [View live project](https://tilt-bot.shivamtaneja.com/)

  <SubSection title="About The Project">
    - Tilt-Bot is an AI-powered gaming roast generator that creates witty, non-toxic comebacks for gamers.
    - It offers a fun way to engage in playful banter without crossing into harmful territory, helping to maintain a positive gaming environment while still enjoying the competitive spirit of gaming.

  <SubSection title="Inspiration">
    - The inspiration for Tilt-Bot came from observing gaming communities where trash talk is common but can often cross boundaries into toxicity. 
    - I wanted to create a tool that preserves the fun of competitive banter while filtering out genuinely harmful content, demonstrating how AI can be used to promote healthier online interactions in gaming spaces.
