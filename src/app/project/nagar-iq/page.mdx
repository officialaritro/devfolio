  - [Explore NagarIQ](https://nagar-iq.shivamtaneja.com/)  
  - [Download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shivamtaneja.nagariq)  

  <SubSection title="About The Project">
    - NagarIQ is a city-focused app that visualizes live data such as traffic, news, social media, and citizen reports through interactive heatmaps and 3D visualizations.  
    - It combines real-time insights with gamified quiz-style elements to keep learning about the city engaging and fun.  
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="The Challenge">
    - This project was a **personal challenge**: I had never built a mobile app before.  
    - In just **3 weeks**, I learned app development from scratch, built NagarIQ, and successfully deployed it to the **Google Play Store**.  
    - Along the way, I documented everything on my **YouTube channel** so others could learn from my process.  
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="Features">
    - **Real-time Data Heatmaps**: Visualize city activity like traffic, social media buzz, and citizen reports.  
    - **3D Visualizations**: Elevation-based stacks to show data density.  
    - **Citizen Reporting**: Users can submit reports (text, photos, videos) mapped directly to city locations.  
    - **Play Store Deployment**: Available for download on Android devices.  
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="How It Works">
    - **Data Collection**: Pulls from traffic feeds, social media monitoring, citizen reports, and web-scraped news.  
    - **Layer Visualization**: Each data source can be toggled on/off for custom exploration.  
    - **Deployment**: Released on the Google Play Store for broader accessibility.  
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="Challenges Faced">
    - **Learning Curve**: Started with zero experience in app development, learned everything on the go.  
    - **Performance**: Handling real-time updates while keeping the app smooth.  
    - **Design**: Creating a UI that balanced data density with usability.  
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="Future Improvements">
    - **Gamified Knowledge Quizzes**: Play quiz-style challenges tied to real-time city knowledge.  
    - **Leaderboards & Social Features**: Add competitive and community-driven layers.  
    - **Offline Mode**: Let users access quizzes without internet.  
    - **Expanded Data Sources**: More granular city insights beyond traffic/news/social feeds.  
  </SubSection>

  <SubSection title="Learning Journey">
    - I documented the **entire journey** of learning app dev and building NagarIQ on my YouTube channel.  
    - Playlist: [NagarIQ App Dev Journey](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtA2fPoEQxFISMF3yzcx4d3pmBLqUBFr_&si=HJK9oY-aUqLW66bW)  
    - This was as much about building an app as it was about proving that with dedication, you can go from zero to a deployed app in just weeks.
